# Genetic-Algorithms
Work completed in a university module. Biocomputation: Optimisation

The aim of this assignment was to use evolutionary intelligence to solve a set of simple problems as effectively as possible. This was done using information from lectures, Blackboard, and background research to create a genetic algorithm (GA).The algorithm was coded in MATLAB and done by completing the three worksheets on Blackboard, which demonstrate the implementation of a simple evolutionary algorithm. Once a simple GA was implemented, the algorithm was extended to show a competitive performance on several optimisation problems. Any effects of changes in parameters, such as mutation and crossover rates, are explained and visualised using graphs.

There are functions for both Roullete wheel and Tournament selections
